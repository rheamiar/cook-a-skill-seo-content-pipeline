# AI Pattern Library

Reference file for Stage 5 — AI-Pattern Detection & Humanization.

## Structural Red Flags

- Starting every section with "In today's [world/landscape/era]..."
- Ending every section with a summary sentence that restates the heading
- Perfect parallel structure across all bullet points (same length, same syntax)
- Transitioning with "Furthermore," / "Moreover," / "Additionally," / "In conclusion,"
- Using exactly 3 bullet points for every list
- Using dashes anywhere in the article body: bullet dashes (`- item`), mid-sentence dashes (`X - Y`), or em dashes (`X — Y`) — rewrite as separate sentences, use commas/colons, or use numbered lists instead

## Phrase-Level Red Flags

Scan the draft and flag any of the following. Replace each with human alternatives:

| AI Pattern | Human Alternative |
|---|---|
| "It's important to note that..." | Just state the thing directly |
| "In the realm of..." | "In [specific field]..." or cut it |
| "When it comes to..." | Cut it — start with the subject |
| "Delve into" | "Explore," "look at," "break down" |
| "Leverage" (used abstractly) | "Use," "apply," "take advantage of" |
| "Navigate the complexities of..." | Be specific about what's complex |
| "In today's fast-paced world..." | Cut entirely, start with real content |
| "It goes without saying..." | If it goes without saying, don't say it |
| "Comprehensive guide / deep dive" | Describe what you actually cover |
| "Game-changer / revolutionary / transformative" | Describe the actual impact |
| "Unlock the potential of..." | Say what the potential actually is |
| "Empower [people] to..." | "Help [people] do [specific thing]" |
| "As we explore in this article..." | Cut — don't narrate your own article |
| "Suffice it to say..." | Cut |
| "At the end of the day..." | Cut or replace with specific conclusion |
| "[X] represents a..." | Rewrite: "[X] is..." or lead with the implication directly |
| "[X] represents the future of..." | Say what will actually change, with specifics |
| "[X] represents a significant shift..." | "Since [year], [X] has changed how [people do Y]" |
| And-chain: "A and B and C and D" | Break into 2 sentences, or use a short list |
| "not only... but also..." | Usually cut "not only" — just state both things |
| "both... and..." (overused connector) | Restructure into separate clauses |

## Conclusion-Specific Red Flags

| AI Conclusion Pattern | Fix |
|---|---|
| Starts with "In conclusion," / "To summarize," / "In summary," | Cut the opener — start with the actual takeaway |
| Restates every H2 heading as bullet points | Replace with 1–2 sentences of synthesis, not recap |
| Ends with "we hope this article has helped you..." | Cut entirely — end with action or insight |
| "[Topic] represents an exciting opportunity..." | Say what the reader should do with that opportunity |
| Vague closing: "The future of [X] is bright" | Replace with a specific prediction or concrete next step |
| Motivational fluff: "Now is the time to embrace [X]" | Give a specific first action to take |

## Rhythm Red Flags

- Sentences that are all approximately the same length → vary them
- Every paragraph has exactly the same number of sentences → break the pattern
- No contractions anywhere → add contractions where natural (you're, it's, that's)
- No rhetorical questions → add 1–2 where appropriate
- No personal/direct asides → add occasional "Here's the thing:" or "Think about it this way:"

## Flow & Transition Red Flags

- Two or more consecutive paragraphs that start with the same word or structure → rewrite openers
- Paragraphs that end abruptly with no bridge to the next → add a 1-sentence transition
- H2 sections that feel like separate articles with no connection to each other → add closing transition sentences
- Body reads like a list of facts rather than a narrative → add causal connectors ("because", "which means", "the result is")
- Zero transition phrases in the entire article → flag and add at least 5

## Structural Red Flags (additional)

- Content written as floating paragraphs between an H2 and its H3 subsections → move all content inside the H3s
- FAQ section placed before the conclusion → move FAQ to after conclusion
- Headings that use `— ` or ` - ` as a separator → rewrite as single natural sentence or use `:` sparingly
- Tool or project name mentioned without official URL on first mention → add URL in parentheses
- H3 section makes a claim with no example, data, or link → flag as "evidence needed"

## Humanization Instructions

1. Read through the draft and highlight every AI pattern found.
2. Rewrite flagged sections using alternatives from the tables above.
3. Add at least 2–3 "human moments": a surprising stat, a counterintuitive point, a concrete micro-example, or a direct question to the reader.
4. Read the final version aloud (mentally) — if it sounds like a robot, rewrite.
