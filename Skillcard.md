# Skill Card — SEO Content Pipeline

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Skill Name** | SEO Content Pipeline |
| **What It Automates** | The full SEO content creation workflow from start to finish in one continuous pipeline: <br>• Keyword research from 3 real data sources <br>• Logic-driven outline mapped to search intent <br>• Human-style draft with real data and named sources <br>• On-page SEO + GEO optimization in a single checklist <br>• AI writing pattern detection and rewriting <br>• Scoring across 6 dimensions with actionable fixes |
| **BEFORE: Manual process** | 4–5 hours per article, inconsistent SEO quality: <br>• Keyword research done manually across separate tools <br>• Outline built from scratch with no standard framework <br>• Writing the draft was the biggest bottleneck (2–3 hours) <br>• SEO optimization done by memory after writing <br>• No scoring step — no way to know if the article was ready to publish |
| **AFTER: With skill** | 15–20 minutes per article, output includes score and ready-to-fix notes: <br>• Keyword research automated from 3 sources with weighted scoring formula <br>• Outline generated from the right flow pattern for the search intent <br>• Draft written to human-style standard with minimum 3 sourced data points <br>• SEO score + GEO score + priority fixes included in every output <br>• No tab-switching or tool-hopping throughout the entire process |
| **Tools / AI Used** | • Claude (claude.ai Projects) <br>• Ahrefs API <br>• Semrush Free Keyword Tool <br>• Google Trends (via web search) <br>• X/Twitter (via web search) |
| **Limitations** | • Ahrefs API requires a paid plan — free mode uses estimated data only <br>• X/Twitter social data is estimated via web search, not a live API <br>• Optimized for informational and commercial investigation content — not suited for landing pages or product pages <br>• No CMS connection for auto-publishing |
| **Roadmap** | • Competitor content gap analysis (Stage 1.5) <br>• Vietnamese language support with VN-specific SEO rules <br>• Internal linking suggestions based on existing content library <br>• Google Search Console integration for real ranking data as input <br>• Multiple entry points: optimize existing draft (Stage 4→5→6) or full rewrite from draft (Stage 2→3→4→5→6) <br>• CMS integration (WordPress/Ghost) to publish directly from output <br>• Native Ahrefs API integration via Claude Code or Dify — pulls live volume and KD data without manual copy-paste |
