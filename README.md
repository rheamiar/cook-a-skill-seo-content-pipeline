# 🔍 Cook A Skill — SEO Content Pipeline

A complete, end-to-end skill for producing SEO content that ranks — and reads like a human wrote it.

---

## What it does

Runs a 6-stage pipeline from raw topic to publish-ready article:

1. **Keyword Research** — finds the best keywords using Google Trends, X/Twitter buzz, and Ahrefs data (volume + difficulty)
2. **Outline** — builds a logic-driven structure mapped to long-tail keywords, with community reactions from social as expansion points
3. **Draft** — writes in human style with real data, stats, and cited sources
4. **SEO Optimization** — runs a full on-page checklist (title, meta, headings, density, schema)
5. **AI-Pattern Detection** — identifies and rewrites AI-sounding phrases, structures, and patterns
6. **Scoring Report** — grades the article across 5 dimensions with actionable feedback

---

## Requirements

- Ahrefs API key (for keyword volume + difficulty data)
- Web search enabled (for Google Trends + X/social buzz)

---

## How to use

Provide a topic and your Ahrefs API key. The skill runs all 6 stages in sequence.  
You can also enter at any stage — e.g. hand it an existing draft to get SEO audit + AI-pattern cleanup + score report only.
